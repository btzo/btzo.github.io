At that time, I worked a lot with website development, an easy way to earn extra money along with my studies.
Over time I matured my skills and the roles ranged from backend developer to full-stack developer, data engineer and research engineer.
From a practical point of view, I am a generalist.
I like to work with rapid prototyping and idea validation.</description></item></channel></rss>
